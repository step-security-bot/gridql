# Kafka Event Consumer

The grid is made up of multiple event stores. We have two primary ways of those events being generated:
* user action
  - HTTP Request via the REST API
* system reaction
  - Taking events from a queue

This modules focuses on the latter.

In principle _all_ we have to do is:
* Take event from queue
* Discriminate based on operation type
* Forward to RestAPI
